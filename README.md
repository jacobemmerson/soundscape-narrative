# soundscape-narrative
### Jacob Emmerson, 09/18/23

This project was created for ENGCMP 0610 Composing Digital Media at the University of Pittsburgh. Originally, this project was meant to demonstrate the critical nature of the bus as a method of transportation for groups who either cannot afford a car or do not have the means of owning one. Unfortunately the original recordings -- which all recordings were done by me -- were unable to display the vision I had in mind.

Instead, the soundscape narrative now represents a story from a students perspective, particularly those who are unfamiliar with public transit or those who may have sensory issues. To those unfamiliar with public transit, such as people who did not grow up with transit infrastructure or had a need to take public transit, it can be a relatively intimidating experience given the public nature and diverse crowd who depends on the bus. While one could argue these feelings may have a classist root, the factors of availability and familiarity, or lack thereof, are the premises in which I hope to base this experience. 

Some key notes while listening:
- All audio is recorded from the PRT 71C loop (Oakland -> Downtown -> Point Breeze)
- All audio was recorded in a single take from a single track (originally ~45 minutes, compressed to ~2 minutes)
- All layered audio was cut and manually stitched together from the single recording
